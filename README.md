I created this repository for demonstration purposes. Since I may publish the app on the App Store, the code is kept private. However, it can be shared upon request for hiring purposes.

This is a digital closet mobile app with social media features. Users can upload clothing items, create outfits, share them on their profile, and post them to Instagram Stories. Backend, which is also developed by me, is built with Express.js and deployed to AWS using Terraform.
